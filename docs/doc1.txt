The human circulatory system consists of the heart, blood, and blood vessels. 
The heart pumps oxygenated blood through arteries to various parts of the body. 
Veins return deoxygenated blood back to the heart. 
Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that allow the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients between blood and tissues.
